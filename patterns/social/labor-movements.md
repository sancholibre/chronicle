# Labor Movements and Worker Power Cycles

## Summary

Worker organizing follows boom-bust cycles tied to economic conditions, technology, and political alignment. Periods of high worker power (1930s-40s, 1960s-70s) alternate with periods of capital dominance (1880s-1900s, 1980s-2020s). Each cycle features battles over wages, working conditions, and the fundamental question of who benefits from productivity gains.

## What Happened

### First Industrial Era (1830-1880)

**Worker conditions:**
- 12-16 hour workdays standard
- No weekends, minimal holidays
- Child labor widespread
- Dangerous conditions, no compensation for injury
- "Truck system" (company stores, company towns)

**Early organizing:**
- Skilled craft unions (printers, machinists)
- Knights of Labor (1869) — first mass labor organization
- Great Railroad Strike (1877) — largest labor action to date
- Violent suppression by state militias, federal troops

**Outcome:** Unions crushed, workers atomized, capital triumphant

### Gilded Age and Progressive Response (1880-1929)

**Conditions:**
- Carnegie Steel, Standard Oil — monopoly capitalism
- Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (1911) — 146 dead, no fire escapes
- Ludlow Massacre (1914) — Colorado militia kills miners' families

**Organizing:**
- AFL (1886) — craft union federation
- IWW (1905) — "One Big Union" for all workers
- Massive strikes: Homestead (1892), Pullman (1894)

**Victories:**
- Clayton Act (1914) — unions not antitrust targets
- Eight-hour day gains in some industries
- State-level reforms (workers' comp, child labor limits)

**Defeats:**
- Injunctions routinely broke strikes
- Red Scare (1919-20) crushed radical unions
- 1920s: Union membership collapsed

### New Deal Era (1933-1947)

**The Turning Point:**
- Depression discredited laissez-faire capitalism
- FDR coalition included labor
- Wagner Act (1935) — right to organize, NLRB established
- CIO split from AFL — industrial unions organize mass production

**Mass organizing:**
- Sit-down strikes (GM Flint, 1936-37)
- Steel, auto, rubber, meatpacking unionized
- Union membership: 3M (1933) → 15M (1945)
- Working class power peak

**What workers won:**
- 40-hour week, overtime pay
- Social Security
- Unemployment insurance
- Paid vacation becoming standard
- Real wages rising with productivity

### Peak and Decline (1947-1980s)

**The Peak:**
- Treaty of Detroit (1950) — GM workers get COLAs, benefits, stability
- Union household = middle class lifestyle
- 35% private sector union density (1954)

**The Erosion:**
- Taft-Hartley (1947) restricted organizing, banned solidarity strikes
- McCarthy era targeted labor radicals
- Automation began displacing industrial jobs
- Unions became bureaucratic, corrupt scandals

**The Break:**
- PATCO strike (1981) — Reagan fires 11,000 air traffic controllers
- Signal: Government will side with capital against labor
- Union-busting consultants become industry
- Manufacturing offshored, service economy rises

### Current Era (1980s-present)

**The Collapse:**
- Private sector union density: 35% (1954) → 6% (2024)
- "Gig economy" — workers classified as contractors
- Wages stagnate while productivity soars
- Benefits shift from employers to workers (401k vs pension)

**New Organizing:**
- Fight for $15 (2012-)
- Teacher strikes (2018-19)
- Amazon, Starbucks organizing (2021-)
- "Hot labor summer" narrative
- But density still falling

## Timeline

| Era | Union Density | Key Event | Outcome |
|-----|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 1880s | <3% | Haymarket (1886) | Unions crushed |
| 1910s | ~10% | Triangle Fire | Progressive reforms |
| 1935 | ~13% | Wagner Act | Organizing wave |
| 1954 | 35% | Peak | Treaty of Detroit |
| 1981 | 20% | PATCO fired | Decline begins |
| 2024 | 6% (private) | Amazon/Starbucks | TBD |

## Preconditions for Worker Power

1. **Tight labor markets** — Can't fire everyone
2. **Concentrated workplaces** — Easier to organize
3. **Sympathetic government** — Laws matter enormously
4. **Crisis of legitimacy** — Depression, scandal, catastrophe
5. **Solidarity** — Willingness to sacrifice for each other
6. **Geographic concentration** — Company towns, industrial cities

## Preconditions for Capital Power

1. **Loose labor markets** — Replacement workers available
2. **Dispersed workplaces** — Gig workers, remote
3. **Government capture** — Appointees, courts, enforcement
4. **Divided workers** — Racial, ethnic, regional splits
5. **Technological leverage** — Automation threat credible
6. **Global arbitrage** — "We'll move to China"

## Contemporary Perspective

**What workers said:**
- 1880s: "We want bread, but we want roses too"
- 1930s: "Sit down, sit down, sit down"
- 1970s: "What do we want? Contracts!"
- 2020s: "Union strong" (with ironic detachment)

**What capital said:**
- Always: "We can't afford it, we'll go out of business"
- Always: "Unions corrupt, inefficient, third-party interference"
- 1930s: "Communism!"
- 2020s: "We're a family here"

## Actual Outcomes

**What labor won that persists:**
- 40-hour week (legally)
- Overtime concept
- Safety regulations (OSHA)
- Minimum wage (eroded but exists)
- Collective bargaining right (weakened but exists)

**What was rolled back:**
- Union density
- Pension security
- Manufacturing jobs
- Wage-productivity link
- Job security

**Pattern:**
- Victories get locked into law, then eroded
- Cultural expectations shift (weekends, safety)
- But distribution of gains can reverse

## Hindsight

1. **Laws matter enormously** — Wagner Act enabled everything. Taft-Hartley and right-to-work undid it.

2. **Racial division is capital's weapon** — Every major organizing defeat involved dividing white and Black workers.

3. **Success bred complacency** — Unions became bureaucratic, lost radical edge, missed service economy transition.

4. **Global capital > national labor** — When capital can move and labor can't, capital wins.

5. **Culture shifts lag economics** — American anti-union sentiment persists despite stagnant wages.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Power concedes nothing without demand** — Workers got nothing by asking nicely. Disruption forced concessions.

2. **Solidarity is hard to build, easy to break** — It takes years to build trust, moments to exploit divisions.

3. **Structural power > individual bargaining** — One worker can be fired; 10,000 coordinated workers cannot.

4. **Legal frameworks determine organizing feasibility** — Compare US (6%) to Scandinavia (70%+).

5. **Each generation must re-learn** — Memory of struggle fades; each cohort starts over.

## Calibration

**If you're a worker today:**
- Individual negotiation is weak position
- Collective action is historically effective but legally harder
- Tight labor markets are windows of opportunity
- Expect employer anti-union campaigns (they're effective)
- Cultural tide may be shifting (polls show young people pro-union)

**If you're thinking about labor futures:**
- Gig economy classification battles are decisive
- AI/automation is capital's next leverage
- Global coordination is labor's challenge
- Remote work cuts both ways (dispersed but also mobile)

## Key Differences Today

**Harder for labor:**
- Dispersed workplaces
- Weak legal framework
- Global capital mobility
- Decades of anti-union culture

**Potential openings:**
- Tight labor markets (recently)
- Young worker attitudes
- Visibility of inequality
- Social media organizing tools
- Climate/supply chain disruptions creating leverage
