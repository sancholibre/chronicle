# Waves of Democratization and Backsliding

## Summary

Democracy doesn't advance steadily—it moves in waves. Political scientist Samuel Huntington identified three major waves of democratization, each followed by a reverse wave. Currently, scholars debate whether we're in a reverse wave, a fourth wave, or something new entirely. The pattern reveals that democratic transitions are fragile, reversible, and depend heavily on conditions beyond ideology.

## What Happened

### First Wave (1828-1926)

**The Expansion:**
- Origins in US, UK, France
- Gradual expansion of suffrage
- By 1926: ~29 democracies worldwide
- Driven by industrialization, rising middle class, liberal ideology

**Countries democratized:**
- United States (white male suffrage expanded)
- Britain (Reform Acts)
- France (Third Republic)
- Switzerland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
- Much of Western Europe

**Limitations:**
- Mostly wealthy, industrial, Western
- Suffrage still limited (race, gender, property)
- Colonial powers remained undemocratic abroad

### First Reverse Wave (1922-1942)

**The Retreat:**
- Democracies fell from 29 to 12
- Rise of fascism, communism, military dictatorships
- Great Depression shattered faith in liberal democracy

**Countries that backslid:**
- Italy (1922) - Fascism
- Germany (1933) - Nazism
- Spain (1936-39) - Civil War, Franco
- Most of Eastern Europe
- Japan (military takeover)
- Much of Latin America

**Contributing factors:**
- Economic devastation (Depression)
- Weak democratic institutions
- World War I aftermath
- Rise of ideological alternatives
- Elite fear of socialism

### Second Wave (1943-1962)

**The Expansion:**
- Democracies increased from 12 to 36
- Post-WWII occupation and reconstruction
- Decolonization (initial optimism)
- Allied victory discredited fascism

**Countries democratized:**
- West Germany, Japan, Italy (imposed democracy)
- India (world's largest democracy at independence)
- Israel
- Many newly independent colonies (initially)

### Second Reverse Wave (1958-1975)

**The Retreat:**
- Democracies fell from 36 to 30
- Military coups in Latin America, Africa, Asia
- Post-colonial optimism faded
- Cold War pressures

**Countries that backslid:**
- Most of sub-Saharan Africa
- Much of Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile)
- Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines
- Greece (Colonels' coup)

**Contributing factors:**
- Weak institutions in new states
- Cold War interventions (US and Soviet)
- Economic crises
- Ethnic conflicts
- Military ambition

### Third Wave (1974-2000s)

**The Expansion:**
- Began: Portugal's Carnation Revolution (1974)
- Democracies increased from 30 to ~120
- Fall of Soviet Union accelerated it
- "End of History" thesis (Fukuyama)

**Countries democratized:**
- Southern Europe (Spain, Portugal, Greece)
- Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile)
- Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary)
- East Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines)
- South Africa
- Former Soviet states (partially)

**Drivers:**
- Catholic Church shift
- Economic development (middle class)
- Demonstration effects
- US and EU pressure
- Soviet collapse

### Third Reverse Wave? (2005-present)

**Potential Retreat:**
- Freedom House: 16 consecutive years of decline (2005-2021)
- Democratic backsliding in established democracies
- Authoritarian resurgence globally
- "Illiberal democracy" emerges

**Countries experiencing backsliding:**
- Hungary (Orbán)
- Poland (PiS)
- Turkey (Erdoğan)
- Venezuela (Chávez/Maduro)
- Philippines (Duterte)
- India (democratic norms eroding)
- United States (institutional stress)

**Debated:**
- Is this a reverse wave or normal fluctuation?
- Are definitions of democracy too narrow?
- Is technology changing the dynamics?

## Timeline

| Wave | Period | Start # | Peak # | Main Regions |
|------|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| First | 1828-1926 | 5 | 29 | Western Europe, Americas |
| First Reverse | 1922-1942 | 29 | 12 | Europe, Latin America |
| Second | 1943-1962 | 12 | 36 | Post-war, Decolonization |
| Second Reverse | 1958-1975 | 36 | 30 | Global South |
| Third | 1974-~2005 | 30 | ~120 | Global |
| Third Reverse? | 2005-? | ~120 | ? | Global |

## Preconditions

**For democratization:**
1. **Economic development** - Middle class, not dependent on state
2. **Prior experience** - Colonial parliaments, local governance
3. **External pressure** - Powerful democracies nearby
4. **Elite splits** - Regime divisions create openings
5. **Civil society** - Organizations outside state control
6. **National unity** - Agreement on who "the people" are

**For backsliding:**
1. **Economic crisis** - Especially affecting middle class
2. **Institutional weakness** - Courts, parties, media not robust
3. **Polarization** - Delegitimization of opponents
4. **External support for authoritarians** - Powers backing strongmen
5. **Security threats** - Real or manufactured
6. **Charismatic leader** - Who can claim popular mandate against institutions

## Contemporary Perspective

**What democratizers said:**

1970s-90s:
- "History is moving toward freedom"
- "The people will always choose democracy"
- "Development leads to democracy"
- "The international community will support transitions"

**What skeptics said:**
- "Democracy requires preconditions"
- "Elections aren't enough"
- "Culture matters"
- "The West is projecting its values"

**What authoritarians said:**
- "Western democracy doesn't fit our culture"
- "We need development first, democracy later"
- "Stability is more important than freedom"
- "Look at your democracies' problems"

## Actual Outcomes

**What democratization optimists got wrong:**
- Democracy isn't inevitable or irreversible
- Elections can legitimate authoritarians
- Economic development doesn't guarantee democratization
- "The people" don't always choose liberal democracy

**What they got right:**
- Wave pattern is real
- External environment matters
- Development does correlate (imperfectly) with democracy
- Some transitions stuck permanently

**What we learned:**
- Consolidation takes longer than transition
- Institutions matter more than elections
- Democratic backsliding can be gradual
- Technology changes the game (but unclear how)

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Democracy is fragile everywhere** - Even old democracies can backslide. There's no permanent safe harbor.

2. **Waves reverse** - Every expansion has been followed by contraction. Expecting only progress is ahistorical.

3. **Economic factors are powerful** - Crises and inequality threaten democracies; prosperity supports them (usually).

4. **Institutions > Elections** - Countries with free elections but weak institutions often backslide.

5. **International context matters** - Powerful neighbors and global hegemons shape what's possible.

6. **Timescales are long** - Consolidation takes decades. Quick judgments mislead.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Change comes in waves, not lines** - Expect cycles, not monotonic progress in any domain.

2. **Backlash is predictable** - Expansion creates counter-reactions. Third wave was bound to face pushback.

3. **Institutions are stickier than leaders** - Focus on institution-building over personality-driven politics.

4. **External conditions constrain internal choices** - What's possible depends on the neighborhood.

5. **"Universal" trends aren't** - What applies in Western Europe may not apply elsewhere.

## Calibration For Today

**Signs of healthy democracy:**
- Peaceful transfer of power
- Independent judiciary
- Free press (even if contentious)
- Losing parties accept results
- Civil society thrives

**Warning signs:**
- Leaders questioning election legitimacy
- Court-packing or institutional capture
- Press freedom declining
- Political violence normalizing
- "Emergency" powers becoming permanent

**Hard questions:**
- Is current backsliding a wave or fluctuation?
- Does technology fundamentally change the pattern?
- Can democracies reform themselves mid-decline?
- What comes after the third wave?
