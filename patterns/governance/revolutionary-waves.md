# Revolutionary Waves

## Summary

Revolutions tend to cluster in time and space, spreading across borders through demonstration effects, shared grievances, and psychological contagion. The pattern is remarkably consistent: initial success somewhere sparks attempts elsewhere; most fail or are reversed; a few transform their societies. Understanding this pattern helps calibrate expectations during apparent revolutionary moments.

## What Happened

### The Springtime of Peoples (1848)
- Began in Sicily (January), spread to France (February)
- Within weeks: Austria, German states, Italian states, Hungary
- Demands: constitutional government, national self-determination, social reform
- By 1849: Most revolutions crushed by conservative forces
- Outcome: Short-term failure; long-term constitutional gains; nationalism strengthened

### 1989: The Fall of Communism
- Poland (June): first semi-free elections
- Hungary (October): opens border to Austria
- East Germany (November): Berlin Wall falls
- Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania followed
- By end of year: communist governments fallen across Eastern Europe
- Outcome: Mostly successful; some countries struggled (Romania); Russia collapsed later

### Color Revolutions (2003-2005)
- Serbia (2000): Bulldozer Revolution
- Georgia (2003): Rose Revolution
- Ukraine (2004): Orange Revolution
- Kyrgyzstan (2005): Tulip Revolution
- Common features: disputed elections, mass protests, regime change
- Outcome: Mixed; some consolidated democracy, others reverted

### Arab Spring (2010-2012)
- Tunisia (December 2010): Bouazizi self-immolation
- Egypt (January 2011): Tahrir Square
- Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and others
- Social media accelerated spread
- Outcome: Mostly failure; Tunisia sole relative success; Syria became civil war

### 2019-2020 Global Protests
- Hong Kong, Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, France (Yellow Vests)
- Different specific triggers, similar general grievances
- COVID-19 interrupted momentum
- Outcome: Mixed; some reforms, much repression

## Timeline

| Wave | Geographic Spread | Speed | Success Rate | Lasting Change |
|------|-------------------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1848 | European | Months | <10% | Low (mostly reversed) |
| 1989 | Eastern Europe | Months | ~80% | High |
| 2003-05 | Post-Soviet | Years | ~50% | Mixed |
| 2011 | Arab world | Weeks | <10% | Low (mostly reversed) |
| 2019 | Global | Months | <20% | Mixed |

## Preconditions

For revolutionary wave to form:
1. **Demonstration effect** - Success somewhere shows it's possible
2. **Shared grievances** - Economic, political, or social conditions similar across region
3. **Communication** - Word spreads (telegraph in 1848, TV in 1989, social media in 2011)
4. **Regime vulnerability** - Governments lack legitimacy or capacity
5. **External context** - Great power support/opposition matters
6. **Critical mass** - Enough people willing to take risks

## Contemporary Perspective

**What revolutionaries said:**
- "Our moment has come"
- "The regime is crumbling"
- "The people united will never be defeated"
- "This time is different"
- "History is on our side"

**What skeptics said:**
- "The regime will survive"
- "They don't have a plan for after"
- "External powers will intervene"
- "Economic reality will reassert itself"
- "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss"

## Actual Outcomes

**What revolutionaries got right:**
- Regimes ARE vulnerable at times
- Mass mobilization CAN topple governments
- Moments of possibility ARE real

**What revolutionaries got wrong:**
- Overthrowing is easier than building
- Unity against old regime doesn't mean agreement on new one
- International context constrains outcomes
- Revolutions often end in new authoritarianism or chaos

**What skeptics got right:**
- Most revolutions fail or reverse
- Institution-building is hard
- Economic and geopolitical constraints are real

**What skeptics got wrong:**
- 1989 showed genuine transformation is possible
- Tunisia showed Arab Spring wasn't entirely futile
- Change CAN be permanent

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Contagion is real** - Revolutions cluster; psychological and informational linkage matters
2. **Speed doesn't predict durability** - Fast spread can mean shallow roots
3. **What comes after matters most** - Overthrowing is the easy part
4. **External actors often decisive** - Great power support or opposition shapes outcomes
5. **Base rates are low** - Most revolutionary attempts fail

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Revolutionary moments are rare and brief** - Windows open and close
2. **Demonstration effects work both ways** - Success inspires; failure teaches regimes to crush early
3. **Social media accelerates spread but not depth** - Fast organization, weak institutions
4. **Unity against is not unity for** - Coalitions fracture after victory
5. **Economic and geopolitical constraints persist** - Revolution doesn't change everything

## Key Differences To Watch

When might the pattern break?
1. **Sustained international support** - 1989 had Western backing; 2011 had divided powers
2. **Legitimate institutions ready** - Civil society, alternative leaders prepared
3. **Economic viability** - Can new regime deliver materially?
4. **Military defection** - Revolution succeeds when security forces switch sides

## The "1989 or 2011?" Question

When protests erupt, ask:
- Is there external great power support? (1989: yes; 2011: divided)
- Are there institutions ready to take over? (1989: some; 2011: mostly no)
- Is the regime willing to use maximum force? (1989: mostly no; 2011: varies)
- Is there a shared vision for after? (1989: Western integration; 2011: unclear)
