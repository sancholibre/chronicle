# Decolonization and Post-Colonial Trajectories

## Summary

The dismantling of European empires after WWII created dozens of new nations in a few decades. Outcomes varied wildly: some became stable democracies, others descended into dictatorship or civil war. The pattern reveals how initial conditions, colonial legacies, and external interventions shaped trajectories—and offers sobering lessons about the difficulty of building nations from colonial inheritances.

## What Happened

### South Asian Independence (1947-1948)
- India and Pakistan partitioned; 10-20 million displaced, 1-2 million died
- Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) followed
- India: democratic, federal, but grinding poverty for decades
- Pakistan: military coups, eventual split (Bangladesh, 1971)
- Outcome: Democracy survived in India; fragile elsewhere

### African Independence Wave (1957-1968)
- Ghana first (1957), then accelerating cascade
- 17 African countries independent in 1960 alone ("Year of Africa")
- Initial optimism: development, African unity, modernization
- Reality: coups, one-party states, Cold War interventions
- By 1970s: few democracies; military rule common
- Outcome: First generation of leaders mostly became autocrats or were overthrown

### Portuguese Decolonization (1974-1975)
- Last European empire to fall; held on until Carnation Revolution in Portugal
- Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau: armed liberation movements
- Independence coincided with Cold War rivalry
- Proxy wars devastated Angola and Mozambique
- Outcome: Decades of civil war; slow recovery

### End of White Rule in Southern Africa (1980-1994)
- Zimbabwe (1980): liberation to autocracy to collapse
- Namibia (1990): relatively stable
- South Africa (1994): negotiated transition; ANC democracy
- Outcome: South Africa's transition widely celebrated; Zimbabwe became cautionary tale

## Timeline

| Region | Peak Period | Method | Typical Outcome |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| South Asia | 1947-48 | Negotiated + partition violence | Mixed (India stable, Pakistan unstable) |
| Southeast Asia | 1945-65 | Varied (negotiated to armed struggle) | Varied |
| Middle East/North Africa | 1951-62 | Negotiated to armed struggle | Mostly autocracy |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 1957-68 | Mostly negotiated | One-party states, coups |
| Portuguese Africa | 1974-75 | Armed struggle | Civil wars |
| Southern Africa | 1980-94 | Armed struggle to negotiated | Mixed |

## Preconditions

For independence to occur:
1. **Imperial exhaustion** - WWI/WWII weakened European powers
2. **Nationalist movements** - Educated elites demanding self-rule
3. **International pressure** - US and USSR both (for different reasons) anti-colonial
4. **UN framework** - Self-determination as international norm
5. **Demonstration effects** - Each independence made others more likely

For post-independence success:
1. **Institutional inheritance** - Some colonial institutions were usable
2. **National unity** - Less ethnic fragmentation
3. **Economic viability** - Resource base or strategic location
4. **External support** - Continued assistance without interference
5. **Leadership quality** - First generation's choices shaped decades

## Contemporary Perspective

**What independence leaders said:**
- "We will build a new nation"
- "Colonial borders don't define us, but we'll work within them"
- "Development will unite the people"
- "One-party rule is needed for stability" (common justification)

**What colonial powers said:**
- "They're not ready for self-rule"
- "Chaos will follow our departure"
- "We built the infrastructure; they'll destroy it"
- (Later) "We tried to prepare them"

**What Cold War powers said:**
- "This country is strategically important"
- "We must prevent the other side from gaining influence"
- "Development assistance" (often with strings)

## Actual Outcomes

**What optimists got right:**
- Independence was achievable
- Colonial rule was unsustainable
- Some countries DID succeed (Botswana, Mauritius, eventually many others)
- Self-determination matters morally regardless of outcomes

**What optimists got wrong:**
- Development harder than expected
- National unity often fragile
- Democracy rarely took root in first decades
- Colonial economic structures persisted (dependency)

**What colonial apologists got right:**
- Institutional capacity was weak
- Ethnic divisions were real (though often colonially exacerbated)
- Some infrastructure was useful

**What colonial apologists got wrong:**
- "Not ready" was self-serving and often racist
- Many colonial institutions were extractive, not developmental
- Colonial powers often actively undermined successor states

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Colonial borders created problems** - States often didn't match nations
2. **Institutional inheritance mattered** - India's civil service, courts helped stability
3. **Cold War distorted trajectories** - Superpowers propped up dictators
4. **Economic structures persisted** - Commodity dependence, extraction continued
5. **Violence at independence shaped decades** - Partition trauma, liberation war trauma
6. **Path dependence is strong** - First decade often set trajectory for generation

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Liberation ≠ nation-building** - Overthrowing colonizers is one thing; building states is another
2. **External interference matters** - Cold War powers often more influential than domestic actors
3. **Initial conditions constrain** - Resources, borders, institutions at independence shape outcomes
4. **Success is possible but not guaranteed** - Botswana, Singapore show it can work
5. **Colonial legacy is mixed** - Some institutions useful, many extractive or divisive

## Key Differences To Watch

When might the pattern break?
1. **Different economic context** - Globalization changes development paths
2. **Less great power interference** - Though China's role rising
3. **Stronger international norms** - Human rights, governance standards
4. **Technology** - Communication, governance tools changed

## Modern Parallels

- **State-building after intervention** - Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya faced similar challenges
- **Breakaway states** - Kosovo, South Sudan as "independence" in different context
- **Post-Soviet transitions** - Similar dynamics of sudden independence
- **Hong Kong, Taiwan** - Different decolonization/separation dynamics

## Comparative Cases

| Country | Colonial Power | Outcome | Why |
|---------|----------------|---------|-----|
| Botswana | UK | Success | Small, unified, diamonds, good leadership |
| DRC | Belgium | Failure | Size, extraction, assassination, Cold War |
| India | UK | Mixed success | Strong institutions, size, democracy survived |
| Singapore | UK | Success | Strategic location, strong leadership, small |
| Zimbabwe | UK | Initial success, then collapse | Liberation hero became autocrat |
