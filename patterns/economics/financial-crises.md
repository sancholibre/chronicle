# Financial Crises and Memory Cycles

## Summary

Financial crises follow a rough generational cycle: crisis → regulation → stability → complacency → deregulation → innovation → crisis. Each generation believes it has learned the lessons of the past, only to repeat them in new form. The specific mechanisms change (railroads, stocks, mortgages, derivatives), but the pattern of leverage, overconfidence, and collapse persists.

## What Happened

### The Pattern Repeating

**Panic of 1873:**
- Railroad overbuilding, bank failures
- Long depression (23 years of deflation)
- Led to: National banking reforms

**Panic of 1907:**
- Stock speculation, trust companies
- JP Morgan organized private bailout
- Led to: Federal Reserve creation (1913)

**Great Depression (1929-1939):**
- Stock speculation on margin
- Bank runs, debt deflation
- Led to: FDIC, Glass-Steagall, SEC

**Savings & Loan Crisis (1980s):**
- Deregulation + moral hazard
- $160 billion bailout
- Led to: Stricter capital requirements (temporarily)

**Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998):**
- Capital account liberalization
- Currency pegs + hot money
- Led to: Reserves accumulation, IMF reforms

**Global Financial Crisis (2008):**
- Mortgage securitization, derivatives
- Lehman collapse, credit freeze
- Led to: Dodd-Frank, Basel III

### The 2008 Crisis in Detail

**The Buildup:**
- 1999: Glass-Steagall repealed
- 2000s: Mortgage lending standards collapse
- CDOs, CDS spread risk (and hid it)
- Rating agencies compromised
- Leverage ratios: 30:1 or higher

**The Trigger:**
- Housing prices peaked 2006
- Subprime defaults rose
- Bear Stearns hedge funds failed (June 2007)
- Lehman bankruptcy (September 2008)

**The Response:**
- Fed: $700B TARP, QE programs
- Treasury: Bank bailouts, stress tests
- Congress: Stimulus, Dodd-Frank

**The Aftermath:**
- Great Recession (2008-2009)
- Slow recovery (10 years to pre-crisis employment)
- Regulatory tightening (now partially unwound)

## Timeline

| Crisis | Cause | Response | Years Until Next Major |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| 1873 | Railroads | Banking reform | 34 |
| 1907 | Speculation | Fed created | 22 |
| 1929 | Margin buying | Glass-Steagall, FDIC | 50+ (S&L smaller) |
| 2008 | Securitization | Dodd-Frank | TBD |

## The Memory Cycle

### Phase 1: Crisis and Reform
- Crisis occurs
- Public outrage
- Comprehensive regulation
- "Never again"

### Phase 2: Stability
- Regulations work
- Finance becomes "boring"
- Steady growth
- Crisis fades from memory

### Phase 3: Complacency
- New generation of regulators
- Industry lobbies for "modernization"
- Innovation around rules
- "This time is different"

### Phase 4: Deregulation
- Rules relaxed
- New instruments created
- Risk taking rewarded
- Leverage builds

### Phase 5: Crisis
- Return to Phase 1

**Typical cycle length:** 30-50 years (roughly generational)

## Preconditions

For financial crisis:
1. **Credit expansion** — Easy lending, low rates
2. **Leverage** — Borrowed money amplifies gains/losses
3. **Innovation** — New instruments that obscure risk
4. **Complacency** — "We've solved the instability problem"
5. **Regulatory capture** — Watchdogs become cheerleaders
6. **Herding** — Everyone doing the same trade

## Contemporary Perspective

**What bankers said before each crisis:**
- "Risk is well-managed and distributed"
- "Our models capture tail risk"
- "Diversification protects us"
- "This time is different"

**What Cassandras said:**
- "Leverage is too high"
- "We don't understand these instruments"
- "History suggests this ends badly"
- (Usually early, lost credibility before crisis)

## Actual Outcomes

**What we learned (temporarily):**
- Leverage kills
- Complexity hides risk
- "Too big to fail" creates moral hazard
- Private gains, socialized losses
- Regulators need authority and will to use it

**What we forgot:**
- Same lessons learned in 1930s, 1980s
- Each generation thinks it's smarter
- Lobbying erodes safeguards
- Innovation outpaces regulation

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Memory is short** — Crisis lessons last about one career span.

2. **Leverage is the common denominator** — Every crisis involves too much borrowed money.

3. **Innovation obscures risk** — New instruments hide old dangers.

4. **Regulation erodes** — Constant pressure to "modernize" (weaken) rules.

5. **Warning signs are visible** — But those who see them are dismissed.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Institutional memory matters** — Organizations need people who remember last crisis.

2. **"This time is different" is a warning sign** — The phrase appears before every crisis.

3. **Leverage limits save the system from itself** — Boring banking is safe banking.

4. **Crisis is the price of complacency** — Stability breeds instability (Minsky).

5. **Reform windows are short** — Regulate in the crisis; window closes with recovery.

## Calibration For Today

**Questions to ask:**
- How levered is the system?
- What instruments are poorly understood?
- Who's saying "this time is different"?
- How much has been deregulated since 2010?
- What risks have migrated to non-banks?

**Warning signs:**
- Novel instruments growing rapidly
- Leverage ratios rising
- Risk models showing low risk (they always do before crises)
- Regulators confident
- Critics dismissed as "not understanding"

**What history suggests:**
- Another crisis will come
- Probably not in the same form
- Probably sooner than comfortable
- Probably preventable (but won't be)

## The Minsky Moment

Economist Hyman Minsky described the cycle:
1. **Hedge finance** — Income covers principal + interest
2. **Speculative finance** — Income covers interest only
3. **Ponzi finance** — Income covers neither; needs asset appreciation

As stability persists, system migrates from hedge to Ponzi. Then small shock triggers collapse.

"Stability is destabilizing."
