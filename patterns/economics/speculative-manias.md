# Speculative Manias and Crashes

## Summary

Financial bubbles follow a remarkably consistent pattern across centuries: a genuine innovation sparks interest, easy credit amplifies speculation, prices detach from fundamentals, narratives justify new valuations, then collapse. The pattern has repeated with tulips, stocks, real estate, and crypto—each time with participants convinced "this time is different."

## What Happened

### Dutch Tulip Mania (1634-1637)
- Tulips were genuinely novel and beautiful in Europe
- Futures contracts allowed speculation without physical bulbs
- Prices rose 20x in months at the peak
- Single bulbs traded for the price of Amsterdam houses
- Crash came in February 1637—market simply stopped
- Outcome: Financial damage was contained to speculators; Dutch economy continued growing

### South Sea Bubble (1720)
- South Sea Company promised monopoly on South American trade
- Stock rose 10x in months
- Isaac Newton lost £20,000 ("I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people")
- Politicians and nobility were implicated in corruption
- Crash destroyed trust in joint-stock companies for decades
- Outcome: Regulatory reforms, but also lasting suspicion of financial innovation

### Railway Mania (1840s)
- Railways were genuinely transformative technology
- Over 400 railway companies formed in Britain
- £250 million invested (equivalent to GDP of small countries)
- Many lines were redundant or impossible to build profitably
- Crash of 1847 wiped out many investors
- Outcome: Railway network got built anyway, but at tremendous waste and human cost

### 1929 Stock Crash
- "New Era" thinking: permanent prosperity through scientific management
- Margin buying allowed 10:1 leverage
- Stock prices quadrupled in the 1920s
- Crash: 89% decline from peak to trough
- Outcome: Great Depression, regulatory reform (SEC), lasting cultural memory

### Dot-com Bubble (1995-2000)
- Internet was genuinely transformative
- "New Economy" thinking: old valuation rules don't apply
- Companies with no revenue valued at billions
- NASDAQ rose 400% then fell 78%
- Outcome: Many surviving companies (Amazon, Google) became dominant; massive wealth destruction

### US Housing Bubble (2003-2008)
- "Housing never goes down nationally"
- Financial innovation (CDOs, MBS) hid risk
- Leverage throughout financial system
- Home prices fell 27% nationally, more in hot markets
- Outcome: Global financial crisis, millions of foreclosures, decade of slow recovery

### Crypto (2017-2022)
- Blockchain genuinely novel technology
- "Digital gold" and "decentralized finance" narratives
- Bitcoin rose from $1,000 to $69,000 then fell 77%
- NFTs, meme coins, widespread fraud
- Outcome: Still unfolding; some projects survived, massive retail losses

## Timeline

| Mania | Asset | Peak Multiplier | Crash Depth | Recovery Time |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Tulips (1637) | Bulbs | 20x | 99% | Never (bulbs worthless) |
| South Sea (1720) | Stock | 10x | 84% | Decades |
| Railways (1847) | Stock | 3-5x | 70%+ | 10+ years |
| 1929 | Stocks | 4x | 89% | 25 years |
| Dot-com (2000) | Tech stocks | 5x | 78% | 15 years (NASDAQ) |

| Crypto (2022) | Bitcoin | 70x | 77% | Unknown |

## Preconditions

For a speculative mania to form:
1. **Real innovation** - Usually there IS something genuinely new (tulips, railways, internet, blockchain)
2. **Accessible leverage** - Credit available to amplify bets
3. **New participants** - Retail investors who haven't experienced previous crashes
4. **Narratives** - Stories that justify why old rules don't apply
5. **Social proof** - Visible wealth gains by early participants
6. **FOMO infrastructure** - Easy ways to participate (apps, brokers, exchanges)

## Contemporary Perspective

**What people said during each bubble:**
- "This technology changes everything"
- "Traditional valuation doesn't apply to [X]"
- "You don't want to miss this"
- "Smart money is already in"
- "It's different this time because [plausible reason]"
- "I know someone who made a fortune"

**What skeptics said:**
- "This is just like [previous bubble]"
- "Prices are detached from fundamentals"
- "When your taxi driver gives you stock tips, sell"
- "Trees don't grow to the sky"

**Why skeptics were ignored:**
- Skeptics had been saying the same thing for years while prices rose
- Being early is the same as being wrong in trading
- Social cost of missing out vs. social cover of losing together

## Actual Outcomes

**What the optimists got wrong:**
- "New paradigm" valuations didn't hold
- Leverage amplified losses just as it amplified gains
- Most individual participants lost money
- The technology was real, but prices weren't rational

**What the optimists got right:**
- The underlying technology often WAS transformative
- Some early believers became wealthy
- New industries DID emerge from the innovation

**What both sides missed:**
- You can be right about the technology and wrong about the timing
- The infrastructure built during bubbles often has lasting value
- The social/political consequences matter as much as financial ones
- Bubbles redistribute wealth; they don't (usually) destroy economies

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Bubbles are not purely irrational** - There's usually a real innovation at the core. The irrationality is in extrapolation and timing.

2. **Leverage is the killer** - Bubbles hurt most when debt is involved. Cash speculation causes less systemic damage.

3. **Social dynamics override individual rationality** - Smart people get caught up because social incentives dominate.

4. **The aftermath matters more than the peak** - Policy response to crashes shapes recovery more than the crash itself.

5. **Experience doesn't transfer** - Each generation thinks it won't fall for the same patterns, then does.

6. **Something DOES usually remain** - Railways got built. Internet infrastructure survived. Technology advances, even if stock prices don't.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **When something is genuinely new, expect overshoot** - Novel + accessible + narratives = bubble conditions.

2. **"This time is different" is partially true** - The technology IS different. The human psychology isn't.

3. **Timing is impossible** - Identifying a bubble is much easier than knowing when it will pop.

4. **Retail participation is a late-stage signal** - When everyone can participate easily, the smart money is already exiting.

5. **Crashes don't usually destroy the innovation** - They destroy the speculation around it. The technology often continues developing.

## Key Differences To Watch

When might the pattern break?

1. **Centralized control** - Government-backed assets (currencies, central bank interventions) can stay irrational longer
2. **Network effects** - Some assets have genuine increasing returns that justify higher valuations
3. **No leverage** - Cash-only speculation burns slower
4. **Velocity** - Speed of information flow may accelerate both bubble formation and popping
