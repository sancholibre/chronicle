# Great Depression Response and Recovery

## Summary

The Great Depression wasn't just a stock crash—it was a failure of institutions and ideas. Recovery came not from returning to the old normal but from fundamentally rethinking economic relationships. The key insight: the interventions that worked weren't obvious at the time, and the "common sense" responses often made things worse. It took over a decade and a world war to fully recover.

## What Happened

### The Collapse (1929-1933)
- Stock market: -89% peak to trough
- Unemployment: 3% → 25%
- GDP: Fell 30% in real terms
- Bank failures: 9,000+ banks collapsed (40% of total)
- World trade: Collapsed by 65%
- Deflation: Prices fell ~30%

### Initial Response: The Hoover Era (1929-1933)

**What was tried:**
- Voluntary business cooperation to maintain wages
- Tariffs (Smoot-Hawley, 1930) to protect American industry
- Federal Reserve raising rates to defend gold standard
- Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) lending to banks
- Balanced budget ideology: Cut spending as revenues fell

**What happened:**
- Voluntary wage maintenance collapsed as companies failed
- Tariffs triggered retaliation, devastated trade
- Tight money deepened deflation
- RFC helped banks, not people
- Spending cuts deepened the downturn

### New Deal: First Phase (1933-1935)

**What was tried:**
- Bank holiday and deposit insurance (FDIC)
- Abandoning gold standard, devaluing dollar
- Agricultural Adjustment Act (paying farmers to produce less)
- National Recovery Administration (industry codes, minimum wages)
- Civilian Conservation Corps, Public Works Administration
- Securities regulation (SEC)

**What happened:**
- Bank runs stopped (FDIC was transformative)
- Dollar devaluation boosted exports
- NRA was chaotic, struck down by Supreme Court
- Jobs programs employed millions but were underfunded
- Some recovery: GDP grew, unemployment fell to 14%

### Recession of 1937-38

**What happened:**
- FDR tried to balance the budget
- Fed tightened reserve requirements
- Economy immediately crashed again
- Unemployment jumped from 14% to 19%
- Proved premature tightening was deadly

**Lesson learned:**
- Recovery was still fragile
- Stimulus withdrawal was premature
- The Depression wasn't "over" when things improved

### Recovery: 1938-1945

**What actually ended the Depression:**
- Massive deficit spending (eventually for war)
- Federal spending went from 3% to 45% of GDP
- Unemployment hit zero
- Industrial capacity expanded enormously
- Debt-to-GDP hit 120% (higher than today)

## Preconditions

For the Depression to become "Great":
1. **Credit bubble** - 1920s leverage amplified the collapse
2. **Policy mistakes** - Tightening during downturn was catastrophic
3. **Institutional failures** - No deposit insurance, no automatic stabilizers
4. **Gold standard** - Prevented monetary response
5. **Global contagion** - US policies spread worldwide
6. **Ideological rigidity** - "Liquidationism" delayed response

## Contemporary Perspective

**What the orthodox said:**

Pre-1929:
- "Stocks have reached a permanently high plateau" (Irving Fisher, 1929)
- "The economy is fundamentally sound"

During Depression:
- "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers... purge the rottenness" (Andrew Mellon)
- "We must balance the budget"
- "The gold standard is essential"
- "Government intervention will make it worse"

**What heterodox voices said:**
- "The economy can stay depressed indefinitely" (Keynes)
- "Deficit spending can stimulate demand"
- "The gold standard is a 'barbarous relic'"
- "Monetary policy is pushing on a string in a liquidity trap"

## Actual Outcomes

**What conventional wisdom got wrong:**
- Balanced budgets during recessions make things worse
- Tight money during deflation is catastrophic
- "Confidence" doesn't restore itself through austerity
- Trade wars hurt everyone
- Moral judgments about debt don't help recovery

**What worked:**
- Deposit insurance (stopped bank runs permanently)
- Abandoning gold (allowed monetary flexibility)
- Deficit spending (eventually, in massive scale)
- Social insurance (automatic stabilizers)
- Regulation (restored trust in financial system)

**What didn't work:**
- Voluntary cooperation
- Tariffs
- Balanced budget attempts
- Premature tightening
- Hoping it would fix itself

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Demand matters** - An economy can stay depressed for years if demand isn't restored. Markets don't automatically clear.

2. **Policy can make it worse** - The Depression was deepened by bad policy. It wasn't inevitable.

3. **There's no "natural" recovery point** - Without intervention, depressions can last indefinitely. The 1873 depression lasted 23 years in some measures.

4. **Fiscal policy works when monetary policy fails** - At the zero bound, government spending is the only lever.

5. **The war was fiscal stimulus** - WWII ended the Depression through spending, not magic. The spending could have been on anything.

6. **Premature tightening is the classic mistake** - 1937 proved that recovery can be killed by premature austerity. Repeated in 2011 in Europe.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **"Common sense" economics is often wrong** - Balancing household budgets makes sense; balancing government budgets during recession doesn't.

2. **Ideology delays response** - Commitment to gold, balanced budgets, and liquidationism extended suffering by years.

3. **Institutions matter more than policies** - FDIC, SEC, Social Security outlasted specific programs and still shape our economy.

4. **Recovery is fragile** - Early improvement doesn't mean you're out. 1937 was a painful lesson.

5. **Scale matters** - Timid interventions didn't work. It took massive spending (war) to end it.

## Key Differences To Watch

Modern economies have:
- Automatic stabilizers (unemployment insurance, etc.)
- Deposit insurance
- Flexible exchange rates
- Central banks that understand deflation
- Experience with demand management

But also:
- More complex financial systems
- Global interconnection
- Different political constraints
- Debt levels that worry policymakers

## Calibration For Today

When you hear:
- "We must balance the budget during a recession" → Red flag (1937 lesson)
- "The market will fix itself" → Red flag (1929-1933 lesson)
- "Austerity restores confidence" → Red flag (Hoover lesson)
- "This spending will cause inflation" → Maybe, but deflation is worse
- "We can't afford stimulus" → Countries can print their own currency
