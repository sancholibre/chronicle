# Sovereign Debt Crises

## Meta
- **Domain**: economics
- **Era**: 1300s-present
- **Time Scale**: cycles of roughly 50-80 years
- **Confidence**: high

## Summary

Countries default on debt with remarkable regularity. Reinhart and Rogoff documented that nearly every country has defaulted at least once; serial defaulters go through cycles of borrowing, crisis, restructuring, and return to markets. Creditors consistently forget previous defaults and lend again. The "this time is different" mentality persists across centuries.

## Pattern Structure

### The Borrowing Boom
Lending surges when:
- **Global liquidity high**: Low interest rates in rich countries push capital to seek returns
- **Commodity boom**: Resource exporters treated as safe bets
- **Political stability**: New government or reform program earns "credibility"
- **Financial innovation**: New instruments make lending feel less risky

Warning signs ignored:
- Debt-to-GDP ratios rising
- Short-term debt replacing long-term
- Currency mismatches (borrowing in dollars, earning in pesos)
- Contingent liabilities hidden off balance sheet

### The Trigger
Crises begin with:
- **External shock**: Commodity price crash, interest rate hike in US/Europe
- **Capital flight**: Creditors suddenly demand repayment, refuse rollover
- **Currency collapse**: Foreign debt becomes unpayable in local terms
- **Political instability**: Crisis of legitimacy makes adjustment impossible

### The Crisis
Typical sequence:
1. **Denial**: "We're different, markets are wrong"
2. **Emergency measures**: Capital controls, IMF calls
3. **Austerity programs**: Cut spending, raise taxes (often counterproductive)
4. **Default/restructuring**: Haircuts for creditors, new terms
5. **Economic collapse**: GDP drops 5-20%, recovers over years

### The Recovery
Eventually:
- **Debt restructured**: Lower face value, extended maturities
- **Reforms implemented**: Some stick, some don't
- **Memory fades**: Within 5-10 years, country borrows again
- **Creditors return**: "This time the reforms are real"

## Historical Instances

### Spanish Imperial Defaults (1557-1647)
World's richest empire defaulted four times in a century. Silver flows couldn't cover military spending. Genoese bankers kept lending anyway—returns in good years compensated for losses in bad.

### Latin American Independence Defaults (1820s-1870s)
Nearly every new republic defaulted within years of independence. European bondholders lost fortunes. Within decades, lending resumed. Pattern repeated 1870s, 1930s, 1980s, 2000s.

### Weimar Germany (1923)
Hyperinflation effectively defaulted on internal debt. Dawes Plan restructured reparations. Foreign lending flooded in 1924-1929. Crashed again in Great Depression. Demonstrated that inflation is default by another name.

### Latin American Debt Crisis (1982)
Mexican default triggered region-wide crisis. Commercial bank lending halted. "Lost decade" of stagnation. Brady Plan (1989) restructured debt into bonds. Lessons supposedly learned—then Argentina 2001.

### Asian Financial Crisis (1997)
Not traditional default but similar dynamics. Short-term dollar borrowing, sudden reversal, IMF bailouts with conditions. Recovery faster than Latin America—but patterns rhymed.

### Argentina (2001, 2014, 2020)
Serial defaulter defaulted again. Largest sovereign default in history ($100B). Holdout creditors litigated for 15 years. Restructured, borrowed again, defaulted again in 2020. Pattern continues.

### Greece (2010-2018)
Eurozone membership was supposed to make this impossible. Proved otherwise. Multiple bailouts, restructuring, austerity. Couldn't devalue currency like previous defaulters. Slow, grinding crisis worse than sharp default.

## What Rhymes Today

### Post-COVID Debt Surge
Government debt-to-GDP ratios at WWII levels globally. Emerging markets borrowed heavily at low rates. As rates rise:
- Refinancing becomes expensive
- Dollar strength creates currency pressure
- Multiple countries (Sri Lanka, Ghana, Zambia) already in crisis

Pattern suggests more defaults 2023-2028, then memory fades, cycle repeats.

### China's Lending
New creditor complicates traditional restructuring. Less transparent terms, different political interests. BRI projects may create debt traps—or may be restructured like previous lending booms.

### Climate-Vulnerable Countries
Small island states and climate-exposed nations face compounding crises. May need new frameworks beyond traditional IMF approach.

## Lessons

1. **This time is never different** — The specific details change; the pattern doesn't
2. **Creditors have short memories** — 5-10 years after default, lending resumes
3. **Austerity during crisis usually backfires** — GDP falls, debt-to-GDP rises
4. **Default isn't the end** — Countries return to growth, often faster than creditors expect
5. **Early restructuring beats late default** — Negotiated haircut better than crisis collapse

## Caveats

- Reserve currency issuers (US, UK, Japan) follow different rules—can print their way out
- Domestic vs. foreign currency debt changes dynamics enormously
- Multilateral debt (IMF, World Bank) treated differently than commercial
- Bond markets differ from bank lending—coordination problems harder
- "Odious debt" doctrine remains legally underdeveloped
