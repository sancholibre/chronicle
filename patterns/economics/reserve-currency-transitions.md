# Reserve Currency Transitions

## Meta
- **Domain**: economics
- **Era**: 1400s-present
- **Time Scale**: 80-120 years per regime
- **Confidence**: medium

## Summary

Global reserve currencies change roughly every century: Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, British, American. Each transition follows similar pattern—rising power's currency gains acceptance through trade dominance, military backing, and financial innovation, then gradually loses ground as hegemony erodes. Transitions are slow (decades), messy (multiple currencies overlap), and often not recognized until well underway.

## Pattern Structure

### The Rise
New reserve currency emerges through:
- **Trade dominance**: Merchants prefer currency of largest trading partner
- **Military power**: Security umbrella makes currency credible
- **Financial innovation**: New instruments expand usage (Dutch innovations, British sterling bills, US treasury market)
- **Network effects**: More usage increases utility, creates lock-in
- **Debt capacity**: Others willing to hold your IOUs

### The Hegemonic Period
Dominant currency provides:
- **Seigniorage**: Essentially interest-free borrowing
- **Financial power**: Sanction capability, market access as leverage
- **Lower transaction costs**: Global trade priced in your currency
- **Policy flexibility**: Can run deficits others can't
- **"Exorbitant privilege"**: De Gaulle's complaint about dollar

### The Erosion
Decline happens through:
- **Relative economic decline**: Share of global GDP falls
- **Debt accumulation**: Privilege enables over-borrowing
- **Competitor emergence**: New power's economy surpasses old
- **Financial crises**: Confidence shocks accelerate transition
- **Deliberate challenge**: Competitor builds alternative systems

### The Transition
Change is gradual:
- **Multi-currency period**: Old and new overlap for decades
- **No single "replacement" moment**: Sterling remained important long after US surpassed UK
- **Institutional stickiness**: Financial infrastructure slow to change
- **Crisis acceleration**: Wars, defaults, hyperinflation can speed transition
- **New power reluctant**: Reserve status brings burdens too

## Historical Instances

### Portuguese/Spanish (1450-1650)
Silver-backed currencies of Iberian empires. Spanish real de a ocho ("pieces of eight") became global standard. Declined with empire through debt defaults, inflation, loss of colonial monopoly.

### Dutch Guilder (1600-1780)
Amsterdam as financial center. Bank of Amsterdam innovations. Guild's credibility backed by trade and naval power. Declined as Dutch lost ground to Britain in trade and military.

### British Sterling (1815-1944)
Post-Napoleonic dominance. Gold standard anchor. City of London as financial center. Sterling area covered quarter of globe. Decline began late 1800s, accelerated through world wars. Bretton Woods formally ended dominance.

### US Dollar (1944-present)
Bretton Woods established dollar centrality. Nixon shock (1971) ended gold link but dollar remained dominant. ~60% of global reserves, most trade invoiced in dollars. Decline predicted since 1970s; hasn't happened yet.

## The Dollar Today

Signs of erosion:
- **US GDP share declining**: From 40% post-WWII to ~25% now
- **Weaponization concerns**: Sanctions drive search for alternatives
- **Debt levels**: $34T and rising
- **Political instability**: Default threats, institution erosion
- **Chinese competition**: CIPS, bilateral currency agreements, digital yuan

Signs of persistence:
- **No viable alternative**: Euro has problems, yuan not convertible
- **Treasury market depth**: Nothing comparable exists
- **Network effects**: Infrastructure built for dollars
- **Military dominance**: Security umbrella still extensive
- **Capital markets**: US remains destination of choice

## What Rhymes Today

### Dollar Decline Discourse
Current concerns echo 1970s, 1980s, 2008:
- "This time different" arguments on both sides
- Gradual erosion more likely than sudden collapse
- Multi-currency world possible transition state

Pattern suggests:
- Decline will be slower than hawks predict
- But erosion is probably real
- Crisis could accelerate (or consolidate—flight to safety helps dollar)

### Yuan Challenge
China pushing alternatives:
- BRICS expansion
- Oil trade in yuan
- Digital currency development
- Sanctions-proofing infrastructure

But pattern shows:
- Reserve status requires convertibility China won't grant
- Trust requires legal/institutional framework China lacks
- Transition takes generations, not years

### Digital Currencies
Wild card:
- CBDCs could accelerate change
- Or could entrench dollar if US moves first
- Crypto unlikely to replace state currencies for reserves
- Stablecoins may matter for trade settlement

## Lessons

1. **Transitions take generations** — Don't expect sudden shifts
2. **Decline discourse precedes actual decline** — Premature obituaries common
3. **Alternatives must be better, not just available** — Euro exists but hasn't displaced dollar
4. **Military/political power matters** — Currencies backed by security relationships
5. **Financial innovation drives transitions** — New instruments, not just economic size

## Caveats

- Sample size is small (handful of transitions in modern era)
- Each transition had unique features
- Digital age may compress timelines
- Multipolar currency world might be stable state
- US might retain dominance longer than patterns suggest due to unique advantages
