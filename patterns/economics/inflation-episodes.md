# Inflation Episodes and Policy Responses

## Summary

Major inflation episodes share common patterns: monetary expansion meets supply constraints, prices rise, policymakers face the painful choice between recession and continued inflation. The lesson of the 1970s—that delaying the pain makes it worse—shaped a generation of central bankers. But each episode has unique features, and "just raise rates" is often harder than retrospective accounts suggest.

## What Happened

### German Hyperinflation (1921-1923)

**The Context:**
- War reparations demanded in gold/foreign currency
- Government printed money to buy foreign exchange
- Lost productive capacity from war

**The Numbers:**
- Nov 1923: 4.2 trillion marks = 1 USD
- Prices doubled every few days at peak
- Wheelbarrows of cash for bread

**The Resolution:**
- New currency (Rentenmark) backed by land
- Fiscal stabilization (balanced budget)
- Dawes Plan restructured reparations
- Took months, not years, once political will existed

**The Lesson:**
- Hyperinflation is fiscal, not just monetary
- Can be stopped quickly with credible regime change
- Political/social consequences persist for generations

### US Great Inflation (1965-1982)

**The Context:**
- Vietnam War spending + Great Society programs
- Oil shocks (1973, 1979)
- Fed trying to maintain low unemployment

**The Numbers:**
- Inflation: 1.6% (1965) → 14.8% (1980)
- Fed Funds Rate: 4% → 20% (Volcker)
- Unemployment peaked at 10.8% (1982)

**The Phases:**

*Phase 1: Denial (1965-1971)*
- "Inflation is temporary"
- Fed kept rates low to support employment
- Nixon imposed wage-price controls (1971)

*Phase 2: Failed Fixes (1971-1979)*
- Controls created shortages, then unwound with price spikes
- Stop-go policy: tighten, recession fear, ease
- Each cycle left inflation higher

*Phase 3: Volcker Shock (1979-1982)*
- Fed raised rates to 20%
- Accepted severe recession
- Inflation fell from 14.8% to 3.2%
- Cost: worst recession since Depression (at the time)

**The Resolution:**
- Required deliberate, severe recession
- Took 3 years of pain
- Volcker's credibility was key

### Emerging Market Inflations (1980s-1990s)

**Latin America:**
- Brazil: 2,500% inflation (1993)
- Argentina: Hyperinflation multiple times
- Mexico: 160% (1987)

**Common Patterns:**
- Fiscal deficits monetized
- Currency crises compounded inflation
- IMF programs with austerity conditions
- Often required currency pegs or dollarization

**The Resolutions:**
- Varied: currency boards, dollarization, inflation targeting
- Real Plan (Brazil, 1994) became model
- Fiscal reform was always required, not just monetary

### Post-2020 Inflation

**The Context:**
- COVID stimulus ($5T+ in US alone)
- Supply chain disruptions
- Energy price spikes
- Labor market dislocations

**The Response:**
- "Transitory" framing (2021)
- Delayed rate hikes
- Fastest rate hike cycle in decades (2022-2023)

**The Outcome:**
- Still playing out
- Inflation fell faster than 1970s pessimists expected
- But rates stayed higher longer than optimists hoped

## Timeline

| Episode | Peak Inflation | Duration | Resolution | Pain Level |
|---------|---------------|----------|------------|------------|
| German 1923 | 29,500%/month | 2 years | Currency reform | Extreme, quick |
| US 1970s | 14.8% | 15 years | Volcker recession | High, prolonged |
| Brazil 1990s | 2,500% | Years | Real Plan | High |
| US 2020s | 9.1% | ~3 years | Rate hikes + supply healing | Moderate |

## Preconditions

For high inflation:
1. **Monetary expansion** — More money chasing goods
2. **Fiscal pressure** — Deficits create pressure to monetize
3. **Supply constraints** — War, oil shocks, pandemic
4. **Expectations unanchored** — Workers/firms expect inflation to continue
5. **Political resistance to pain** — Unwillingness to accept recession

## Contemporary Perspective

**What inflationists said:**
- "Money printing causes inflation"
- "Fiscal deficits will catch up"
- "Central banks are behind the curve"

**What deflationists said:**
- "Demographics are deflationary"
- "Technology reduces prices"
- "Debt is deflationary"

**What "transitory" believers said:**
- "Supply chains will heal"
- "Base effects will pass"
- "It's not the 1970s"

## Actual Outcomes

**What 1970s taught:**
- Delay makes it worse
- Credibility matters enormously
- Supply shocks can become entrenched
- Stop-go policy is the worst of both worlds

**What was different post-2020:**
- Much faster response (eventually)
- Supply chains did partially heal
- Expectations stayed more anchored
- Globalization provided deflationary offset

**What remains uncertain:**
- Long-term fiscal trajectory
- Whether 2% target is appropriate
- How much structural change (remote work, reshoring)

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **Expectations are everything** — Inflation becomes entrenched when people expect it to continue and price/wage accordingly.

2. **"Transitory" is dangerous framing** — Even if technically true, it signals complacency.

3. **There is no painless exit** — Either you accept recession or you accept inflation. Trying to avoid both usually gets you both.

4. **Credibility is hard to build, easy to lose** — Volcker's credibility took years of pain. It can be lost in months.

5. **Fiscal and monetary can't be separated** — Ultimately, sustained inflation requires fiscal accommodation.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Early, strong action beats delayed, weak action** — The 1970s lesson, still being relearned.

2. **"This time is different" is sometimes right** — Post-2020 wasn't the 1970s, but acting as if it might be was prudent.

3. **Political economy constrains optimal policy** — Central bankers don't operate in a vacuum.

4. **Supply matters, not just demand** — Oil shocks, supply chains—monetary policy can't fix everything.

5. **The pain is real either way** — Inflation is a tax; recession is visible unemployment. Both hurt.

## Calibration For Today

**Signs inflation might persist:**
- Fiscal deficits remain large
- Labor markets stay tight
- Expectations become unanchored
- Central bank credibility questioned

**Signs inflation might fade:**
- Supply chains normalize
- Commodity prices stabilize
- Rate hikes slow demand
- Technology/globalization resume deflationary pressure

**What history suggests:**
- Take inflation seriously
- Act earlier rather than later
- But each episode has unique features
- "Just do what Volcker did" isn't always applicable
