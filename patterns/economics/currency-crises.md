# Currency Crises and Hyperinflation

## Summary

Currency crises and hyperinflations are rare but catastrophic. They typically follow war, revolution, or severe political dysfunction that destroys fiscal capacity. The pattern is consistent: governments print money to pay debts → currency loses credibility → prices spiral → society fragments → painful stabilization (often with external help). The psychological and political scars last generations.

## What Happened

### Weimar Germany (1921-1923)

**Cause:**
- WWI reparations (132 billion gold marks)
- Ruhr occupation (1923) — France seizes industrial heartland
- Government printed money to pay workers, resist occupation
- No political consensus for fiscal reform

**The Spiral:**
- July 1914: 4.2 marks per dollar
- July 1922: 493 marks per dollar
- July 1923: 353,000 marks per dollar
- November 1923: 4.2 trillion marks per dollar

**Daily Life:**
- Workers paid twice daily, rushed to spend before lunch
- Wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread
- Barter economy emerged
- Life savings wiped out in weeks
- Middle class destroyed

**Who Benefited:**
- Debtors (including the government)
- Those with real assets (land, foreign currency)
- Speculators who timed it right

**Who Lost:**
- Creditors, savers, pensioners
- Fixed-income workers
- Middle class with savings
- Social fabric

**Stabilization:**
- Rentenmark introduced (November 1923)
- Backed by mortgages on German land/industry
- Dawes Plan (1924) restructured reparations
- Stable within months once credible

**Lasting Impact:**
- German fear of inflation persists to today (Bundesbank hawkishness)
- Political radicalization (Hitler cited hyperinflation trauma)
- Distrust of democratic institutions

### Zimbabwe (2007-2009)

**Cause:**
- Land reform collapsed agricultural production
- Government spending to maintain power
- Central bank printed to cover deficits
- No external credibility

**The Spiral:**
- 2006: 100% inflation
- 2007: 66,000% inflation
- November 2008: 79.6 billion percent (monthly)
- Prices doubling every 24 hours

**Daily Life:**
- Stores priced in foreign currency or barter
- Government wages worthless
- Infrastructure collapsed
- Skilled workers fled
- 100 trillion dollar notes printed

**Stabilization:**
- Dollarization (2009) — abandoned own currency
- South African rand and US dollar became legal tender
- Inflation stopped immediately
- But underlying problems remained

### Argentina (Recurring)

**Pattern:**
- Populist spending → deficit → money printing → inflation → crisis → stabilization → repeat

**Episodes:**
- 1989-90: 3,000%+ annual inflation, hyperinflation
- 2001-02: Peso peg collapse, banking freeze, default
- 2018-present: Peso depreciation, 100%+ inflation

**Why it recurs:**
- Political incentives favor short-term spending
- External debt in dollars creates vulnerability
- Weak institutions can't enforce fiscal discipline
- Each crisis creates trauma but also tolerance

### Other Cases

**Hungary (1945-46):**
- Worst hyperinflation ever recorded
- Prices doubled every 15 hours at peak
- Post-WWII chaos, Soviet occupation
- Stabilized with new currency (forint)

**Yugoslavia (1992-94):**
- Civil war financing
- 313 million percent monthly inflation
- Economic collapse alongside political fragmentation

**Venezuela (2016-present):**
- Oil dependence, populist spending
- 1,000,000%+ inflation
- Ongoing crisis, mass emigration
- Partial dollarization, but not resolved

## Timeline of Major Episodes

| Country | Period | Peak Monthly Inflation | Cause |
|---------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Hungary | 1945-46 | 4.19 × 10^16 % | WWII aftermath |
| Zimbabwe | 2007-08 | 7.96 × 10^10 % | Political dysfunction |
| Yugoslavia | 1993-94 | 3.13 × 10^8 % | Civil war |
| Germany | 1923 | 32,400% | WWI reparations |
| Venezuela | 2018 | 200,000%+ | Oil crash, populism |

## Preconditions for Hyperinflation

1. **Fiscal collapse** — Government can't tax or borrow enough
2. **Political inability to reform** — No consensus for spending cuts
3. **Loss of central bank independence** — Printing becomes fiscal tool
4. **External constraint** — Foreign debt, reparations, or sanctions
5. **War or political crisis** — Normal governance suspended
6. **Initial shock** — Something that starts the spiral

## Why It's Rare in Developed Economies

1. **Institutional credibility** — Central banks won't finance deficits
2. **Tax capacity** — Can actually collect revenue
3. **Political legitimacy** — Can impose austerity if needed
4. **Reserve currency status** — Demand for currency stabilizes it
5. **Capital markets** — Can borrow rather than print
6. **External support** — IMF, allies provide backstops

## Contemporary Perspective

**What governments said:**
- "This is temporary"
- "Speculators are attacking us"
- "We must support the workers/people/war effort"
- "Printing money doesn't cause inflation" (until it obviously does)

**What people experienced:**
- Disbelief → adaptation → desperation → numbness
- Erosion of social trust
- "How could they let this happen?"
- Generational trauma

## Actual Outcomes

**What persists after stabilization:**
- Fear of inflation in collective memory
- Changed political alignments
- Emigration (skilled workers leave)
- Distrust of institutions
- Conservative monetary policy

**What recovers:**
- Nominal stability (often quickly)
- Economic activity (slowly)
- International credibility (decades)
- Social cohesion (generations)

**The paradox:**
- Hyperinflation is easy to stop once there's will
- Stabilization often happens within months
- But the will requires political change

## Hindsight

1. **Inflation is always about fiscal capacity** — Money printing is symptom, not cause.

2. **Once credibility is lost, it's binary** — Gradual erosion suddenly becomes collapse.

3. **Middle class destruction has political consequences** — Weimar's hyperinflation helped enable Nazism.

4. **External anchors can work** — Dollarization, currency boards, external oversight.

5. **Memory fades** — Argentina repeatedly returns to the pattern.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Inflation expectations are self-fulfilling** — Once people expect inflation, they demand higher wages/prices.

2. **Fiscal sustainability determines monetary stability** — You can't print your way out of real deficits forever.

3. **Institutional trust is precious and fragile** — Takes decades to build, months to destroy.

4. **Social contract erosion is the real damage** — Not just economic loss but loss of shared reality.

5. **Dollarization is last resort, not solution** — It stops inflation but surrenders monetary sovereignty.

## Calibration

**Should you worry about hyperinflation?**

**In developed economies (US, EU, Japan):**
- Requires political breakdown, not just bad policy
- Central bank independence is firewall
- Would need war, revolution, or institutional collapse
- Not impossible but requires preconditions we don't have
- High inflation ≠ hyperinflation (10% vs 10,000%)

**In emerging markets:**
- More preconditions often present
- External debt creates vulnerability
- Institutional capacity varies
- History of episodes matters (Argentina vs Chile)

**Warning signs:**
- Central bank losing independence
- Money financing of deficits
- Capital flight accelerating
- Dollarization of transactions already happening
- Political crisis preventing reform

**Not warning signs (despite claims):**
- Deficit spending during recession
- Quantitative easing by credible central banks
- Moderate inflation (5-10%)
- Debt/GDP ratios (Japan: 260%, no hyperinflation)

## Key Differences Today

**Deflationary pressures:**
- Globalization (cheaper goods)
- Technology (cheaper production)
- Demographics (aging = lower demand)
- Debt overhang (deflationary)

**Inflationary pressures:**
- Supply chain disruptions
- Energy transition costs
- Deglobalization
- Political pressures to spend

**Net assessment:**
- Developed world: High inflation possible, hyperinflation very unlikely
- Emerging markets: Case by case, depends on institutions
- US dollar specifically: Reserve currency status provides huge buffer
