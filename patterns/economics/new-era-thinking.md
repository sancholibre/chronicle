# "New Era" Thinking and Its Failures

## Summary

Periodically, experts and the public become convinced that fundamental economic rules have changed—that cycles are over, that a "new paradigm" has emerged. The 1920s "New Era," the 1960s "New Economics," the 1990s "New Economy," and post-2008 "secular stagnation" all promised permanent change. Each was partially right about real shifts and mostly wrong about the end of familiar patterns.

## What Happened

### The "New Era" (1920s)
- Post-WWI optimism, technological progress (electricity, automobiles, radio)
- Federal Reserve believed to have tamed business cycles
- Fisher's famous "permanently high plateau" (1929)
- Outcome: 1929 crash, Great Depression

### "New Economics" (1960s)
- Keynesian fine-tuning promised to end recessions
- Kennedy/Johnson economists claimed mastery over business cycle
- "We are all Keynesians now" (Nixon, 1971)
- Outcome: Stagflation of 1970s proved theories incomplete

### "The End of History" (1990s)
- Soviet collapse, liberal democracy triumphant
- Fukuyama: ideological competition over
- "No serious alternative to market economics"
- Outcome: China's rise, populism, authoritarianism resurgent

### "New Economy" (1990s-2000)
- Internet revolution, productivity growth
- "Old rules don't apply"—valuation without profits
- "This time is different"—Glassman's "Dow 36,000"
- Outcome: Dot-com crash (2000)

### "Great Moderation" (2000s)
- Business cycles claimed to be tamed
- Financial innovation "distributed risk"
- "Black swans" were impossible by definition
- Outcome: 2008 financial crisis

### "Secular Stagnation" (2010s)
- Summers: persistent low growth is the new normal
- Low interest rates forever
- "Japan-ification" of developed economies
- Outcome: 2021-2022 inflation surge

## Timeline

| Era | Claim | Proponents | Falsification |
|-----|-------|------------|---------------|
| 1920s | Business cycles ended | Fisher, Hoover | 1929 crash |
| 1960s | Recessions optional | Samuelson, Heller | 1970s stagflation |
| 1990s | History ended | Fukuyama | 2000s authoritarianism |
| 1990s | Old valuation obsolete | Tech analysts | Dot-com crash |
| 2000s | Financial crises tamed | Bernanke | 2008 crisis |
| 2010s | Low growth forever | Summers | 2021 inflation |

## Preconditions

For "new era" thinking to emerge:
1. **Real change** - Something genuinely IS different (technology, policy, structure)
2. **Extended good performance** - Long enough to seem permanent
3. **Expert consensus** - Credentialed believers
4. **Incentives to believe** - Financial/political rewards for optimism
5. **Memory fade** - Previous cycle long enough ago to forget

## Contemporary Perspective

**What "new era" proponents said:**
- "This time is different because [specific reason]"
- "Old models don't account for [new factor]"
- "The skeptics said this before and were wrong"
- "Structural changes have altered fundamentals"
- "Technology has changed everything"

**What skeptics said:**
- "Cycles are human nature"
- "We've heard this before"
- "The longer the expansion, the worse the crash"
- "Hubris precedes falls"

## Actual Outcomes

**What the "new era" thinkers got wrong:**
- Cycles didn't end—they just changed form
- Fundamentals weren't obsolete—just deferred
- Risk wasn't eliminated—just hidden
- Human nature didn't change

**What the "new era" thinkers got right:**
- Something WAS genuinely different (technology, policy, globalization)
- Old models WERE incomplete
- Structural changes DID alter some dynamics
- Some things DON'T revert to old patterns

**The pattern:**
1. Real change occurs → 2. Experts extrapolate → 3. "Old rules don't apply" → 4. Overconfidence → 5. Crash/correction → 6. "How could we have missed this?"

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **"New era" thinking is always half-right** - Something IS different. The error is assuming the difference eliminates all previous patterns.

2. **Cycles change form but don't disappear** - Business cycles, financial cycles, political cycles—they transform but persist.

3. **Extrapolation is the enemy** - The mistake is projecting current trends indefinitely.

4. **Expert consensus is a warning sign** - When everyone agrees, check your assumptions.

5. **Memory is short** - 10-15 years is enough to forget the last crisis.

6. **Incentives drive belief** - People believe what benefits them to believe.

## Generalizable Insights

1. **"This time is different" is the most dangerous phrase** - Respect it as a warning sign.

2. **Ask: what would falsify this?** - If nothing could prove the "new era" wrong, be skeptical.

3. **Real change + extrapolation = bubble** - The combination is toxic.

4. **Watch for "no one could have predicted"** - Someone always predicted it; they were just ignored.

5. **Old patterns morph, they don't die** - Look for familiar dynamics in new clothing.

## Key Differences To Watch

When might "new era" thinking be right?

1. **Genuine structural break** - Post-WWII Bretton Woods WAS different from pre-war
2. **Technology that changes fundamentals** - Internet DID change some things permanently
3. **Institutional innovation** - Central banking DID reduce some cycle volatility

The key: partial truth. New eras exist, but they don't eliminate human nature or economic laws—they just change how they manifest.
