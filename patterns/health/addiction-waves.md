# Addiction Waves Through History

## Summary

Every few decades, a new substance or behavior triggers a cycle: initial embrace as beneficial, growing concern as problems emerge, moral panic and criminalization, eventual harm reduction. The pattern reveals less about the substances than about how societies process unfamiliar risks. Remarkably, each generation believes its particular crisis is unprecedented.

## What Happened

### Gin Craze (1720-1751, Britain)
- Cheap gin flooded London after deregulation
- "Drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence"
- Consumption: 10 million gallons/year for 6 million people
- Moral reformers depicted it as destroying the poor
- Gin Acts imposed regulation, eventually reduced consumption
- Outcome: Heavy drinking continued; just shifted substances

### Opium (1800-1920, Global)
- Laudanum widely available, recommended by doctors
- Opium dens associated with Chinese immigrants (US, UK)
- "Patent medicines" contained opium, marketed to women
- Harrison Act (1914) criminalized non-medical use
- Outcome: Pushed users underground, created black market

### Alcohol Prohibition (1920-1933, US)
- Temperance movement positioned as progressive reform
- Constitutional amendment to ban manufacture and sale
- Speakeasies, organized crime, bathtub gin
- Repeal after 13 years; crime didn't go away
- Outcome: Demonstrated limits of prohibition model

### Tobacco (1950-present, Global)
- 1950s: doctors smoked, cigarettes advertised as healthy
- 1964: Surgeon General's report on cancer
- Decades of industry denial, lawsuits, advertising bans
- Smoking rates fell from 42% (1965) to 14% (2019) in US
- Outcome: Success story, but took 50+ years and ongoing

### Crack Cocaine (1980s, US)
- Cocaine processed into smokable form, cheaper
- Media portrayed as instant addiction, "crack babies"
- Harsh sentencing disparities (100:1 crack vs. powder)
- Devastated Black urban communities
- Outcome: Mass incarceration; harm reduction slow to arrive

### Prescription Opioids (1990s-present, US)
- OxyContin marketed as non-addictive (1996)
- Doctors pushed to treat pain as "fifth vital sign"
- Pharmaceutical companies minimized risks
- 70,000+ overdose deaths per year by 2020s
- Outcome: Ongoing; harm reduction gaining ground

### Social Media/Screens (2010s-present)
- Unlimited access from childhood
- "Engagement" design maximizes time spent
- Concerns about depression, anxiety, attention
- Debate about severity and causation ongoing
- Outcome: TBD—resembles early stage of previous cycles

## Timeline

| Substance | Initial Frame | Peak Crisis | Resolution | Duration |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Gin | Medicine/pleasure | 1740s | Regulation | ~30 years |
| Opium | Medicine | 1900s | Criminalization | ~100 years |
| Alcohol | Social/medicinal | 1920s | Prohibition → repeal | 13 years formal |
| Tobacco | Sophisticated/healthy | 1960s-90s | Regulation/taxation | 50+ years ongoing |
| Crack | Street drug | 1980s | Punishment → reform | ~30 years |
| Opioids | Pain medicine | 2010s | Litigation + harm reduction | Ongoing |
| Screens | Innovation | 2020s | TBD | Early stage |

## Preconditions

For addiction wave to form:
1. **New or newly accessible substance/behavior**
2. **Initial embrace** - Seen as modern, beneficial, or sophisticated
3. **Growing visible harm** - Deaths, dysfunction, social disruption
4. **Vulnerable population identified** - Youth, women, minorities become focus
5. **Moral entrepreneurs** - Reformers who frame issue as crisis
6. **Political opportunity** - Crisis aligns with other agendas

## Contemporary Perspective

**What each era's users/promoters said:**
- "This is different from previous addictions"
- "The benefits outweigh the risks"
- "Moderate use is fine"
- "Personal choice should be respected"

**What reformers said:**
- "This is destroying our society"
- "Think of the children"
- "The [companies/dealers] are predators"
- "We must act before it's too late"

**Why both were partially right:**
- Substances DO cause real harm to real people
- Moral panics DO exaggerate and scapegoat
- Prohibition creates different problems than it solves
- Some people can use without addiction; some can't

## Actual Outcomes

**What reformers got right:**
- New substances/behaviors DO cause harm
- Industry/dealers DO minimize and deny
- Regulation CAN reduce harm (tobacco success)

**What reformers got wrong:**
- Criminalization often worse than the problem
- "Think of the children" rhetoric weaponized
- Racialized enforcement hurt minorities
- Zero tolerance ignores human complexity

**What both missed:**
- Underlying demand persists regardless of policy
- Harm reduction often more effective than prohibition
- Recovery is possible; addiction isn't destiny
- Supply-side approaches alone don't work

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **New substances will keep coming** - Each generation has its crisis
2. **Initial embrace precedes panic** - The arc is predictable
3. **Criminalization creates new harms** - Black markets, incarceration, stigma
4. **Harm reduction works** - Needle exchanges, supervised use, medication-assisted treatment
5. **Industry denial is consistent** - Tobacco playbook repeats (opioids, social media)
6. **Recovery happens** - Despite narratives of hopelessness

## Generalizable Insights

1. **"This crisis is unprecedented" is never true** - The substance is new; the pattern isn't
2. **Watch for the racialization** - Which groups get criminalized vs. medicalized?
3. **Industry denial is a signal** - If they're minimizing, harm is real
4. **Moral panic ≠ no real problem** - Both can be true
5. **Follow the demand** - Why are people seeking escape? What's the underlying pain?

## Key Differences To Watch

When might the pattern break?
1. **Harm reduction mainstreamed** - Portugal model rather than US prohibition
2. **Industry accountability early** - Before decades of denial
3. **Address root causes** - Economic despair, mental health, social isolation
4. **Behavioral addictions** - May require different frameworks than substances
