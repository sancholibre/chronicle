# Energy Transitions

## Summary

Major energy transitions (wood→coal→oil→renewables) take 50-100 years, not the decades often predicted. Each transition generated fears of scarcity, predictions of rapid change, and unforeseen consequences. Understanding this timescale is crucial for calibrating expectations about decarbonization.

## What Happened

### Wood to Coal (1700s-1900)
- British deforestation crisis drove search for alternatives
- Coal known for centuries but required new technology (steam pumps, railways)
- "Peak wood" fears in 1700s Britain
- Transition took ~150 years in UK, longer elsewhere
- Outcome: Powered Industrial Revolution; created new pollution, mining dangers

### Coal to Oil (1860s-1970s)
- Oil discovered in Pennsylvania (1859)
- Automobile and internal combustion engine drove adoption
- "Peak coal" never happened—we just found something better
- Transition took ~100 years to reach dominant share
- Outcome: Transformed transportation, geopolitics, urban form

### Nuclear Promise (1950s-1980s)
- "Too cheap to meter" predictions
- Expected to dominate by 2000
- Accidents (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) + cost overruns halted growth
- Outcome: Stalled at ~10% of global electricity; now reconsidered

### Oil to Renewables (1970s-present)
- Oil shocks sparked interest in alternatives
- Solar/wind costs fell 90%+ since 2009
- "Energy transition in 10-20 years" predicted since 1970s
- Current share: ~15% of primary energy (2024)
- Outcome: Still unfolding; faster than previous transitions but slower than predictions

## Timeline

| Transition | Trigger | Duration to Majority | Actual Time |
|------------|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Wood → Coal (UK) | Deforestation | Predicted: fast | ~150 years |
| Coal → Oil | Automobile | Predicted: fast | ~100 years |
| Oil → Nuclear | Atoms for Peace | Predicted: 25 years | Failed (stuck at 10%) |
| Fossil → Renewables | Climate, cost | Predicted: 20-30 years | Ongoing (~50+ years?) |

## Preconditions

For energy transitions to accelerate:
1. **Cost advantage** - New source must be cheaper (or offer unique capabilities)
2. **Infrastructure** - Distribution, storage, conversion systems take decades
3. **Capital stock turnover** - Existing equipment has 20-50 year lifetimes
4. **Complementary technology** - Coal needed steam engines; oil needed cars; renewables need batteries
5. **Political will** - Subsidies, regulations, standards
6. **Skilled workforce** - New industries need trained workers

## Contemporary Perspective

**What transition optimists said (every era):**
- "Technology is advancing exponentially"
- "Cost curves will continue falling"
- "This is an S-curve—we're at the inflection point"
- "Political will is growing"
- "Old industries will collapse within decades"

**What transition skeptics said (every era):**
- "Existing infrastructure is massive"
- "Intermittency/storage problems aren't solved"
- "Developing countries will use cheap fossil fuels"
- "You can't change this fast without economic damage"
- "Previous transitions took a century"

## Actual Outcomes

**What optimists got wrong:**
- Timeline predictions consistently too aggressive
- Underestimated infrastructure inertia
- "Too cheap to meter" (nuclear) was wildly wrong
- Solar/wind growth impressive but still <20% of primary energy

**What optimists got right:**
- Cost curves DID fall dramatically for solar/wind
- Transitions DO eventually happen
- Old industries DO decline (coal employment collapsed)
- Technology DOES improve faster than expected

**What both sides missed:**
- Transitions can speed up once tipping points hit
- Old and new often coexist longer than expected
- Political factors dominate technical factors
- Energy demand grows—transition means growing renewables faster than fossil fuels, not replacing existing use

## Hindsight

**With the benefit of history, we now understand:**

1. **50-100 years is the normal timescale** - Every transition took generations, not years

2. **Predictions are systematically optimistic** - Nuclear promised too much; solar timeline predictions have repeatedly been too fast

3. **Infrastructure is the bottleneck** - Generation technology can change fast; grids, pipelines, building stock can't

4. **Transitions accelerate at the end** - Coal went from 50% to 20% of UK energy faster than 0% to 50%

5. **Incumbent industries fight back** - Coal interests delayed transition to oil; oil interests now delay renewables

6. **Co-existence is normal** - We still use wood (biomass); we still use coal. Old sources don't fully disappear

## Generalizable Insights

1. **Double or triple timeline predictions** - If someone says 20 years, assume 40-60.

2. **Watch infrastructure, not generation** - A new solar panel is easy; a new grid is hard.

3. **Cost curves matter but aren't sufficient** - Solar is cheaper in many places; transition still takes decades.

4. **Political economy dominates physics** - Technical capability ≠ deployment.

5. **Demand growth complicates everything** - Global energy use keeps rising; renewables must outgrow this growth to displace fossils.

## Key Differences To Watch

When might the current transition be faster?

1. **Climate urgency** - Existential pressure didn't exist for previous transitions
2. **Technology spillovers** - Batteries serve multiple purposes (EVs, grid, devices)
3. **Distributed generation** - Solar panels don't require central infrastructure
4. **Political mobilization** - Climate movement has no equivalent in previous transitions
5. **Developing country leapfrogging** - May skip fossil infrastructure entirely (like mobile phones vs. landlines)

But: similar "this time is different" arguments were made about nuclear in the 1950s.
